Create the files and run using:
python3.11 flight_delay.py
python3.11 dash_interactivity_barplot.py
python3.11 dash_interactivity.py commands respectively.

The three files create bar chart, line chart and other dashboards to analyze the delay in arrival flight times, number of flights available per state and delay time in different statistics of the flights.
